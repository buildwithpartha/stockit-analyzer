# üìä Indian Stock Market Analyzer - Recommendation Logic Guide

## üéØ Overview

This analyzer uses **Rob Booker's Knox Divergence** strategy as the primary signal (60% weight), combined with fundamental analysis (30%) and technical indicators (10%) to generate stock recommendations.

## üîë Key Innovation: Envelope Condition

**CRITICAL RULE:** Any BUY recommendation with bullish divergence is ONLY made when:
```
Current Price ‚â§ Envelope SMA (200-period middle line)
```

This ensures we're buying below the long-term trend for better risk-reward ratios.

## üõ°Ô∏è Envelope Condition Details

### What is the Envelope?
- **Length:** 200-period Simple Moving Average
- **Percentage:** 14% bands above and below
- **Components:**
  - Upper Envelope = SMA √ó 1.14
  - **Middle Line (SMA)** = 200-period average (our key reference)
  - Lower Envelope = SMA √ó 0.86

### Why This Condition?
1. **Better Entry Points:** Buying below long-term average
2. **Risk Management:** Reduces probability of buying at tops
3. **Institutional Support:** 200-period SMA is widely watched
4. **Statistical Edge:** Historical backtesting shows improved results

### Implementation:
```python
# Only allow buy recommendations if:
if divergence_signal in ['STRONG_BULLISH', 'BULLISH', 'HIDDEN_BULLISH']:
    if current_price <= envelope_sma:
        # Allow buy recommendation
    else:
        # Downgrade to HOLD or WEAK_SELL
```
